# Spherical-Orb-Data-Chart-Map
Spherical Orb Data Visualization Project  Orb manipulation: The project includes a set of tools for manipulating spherical orbs, such as sorting, filtering, and transforming data values.  Orb visualization: The project includes a set of visualization tools for rendering spherical orbs in 3D

This project is designed to help users visualize complex data sets using spherical orbs. By mapping data to the surface of a sphere, users can gain insights into relationships and patterns that might be difficult to discern using other types of visualization tools.

Features
Spherical orb generation: The project provides tools for generating spherical orbs from data sets, including support for importing data from CSV files, databases, or APIs.

Orb manipulation: The project includes a set of tools for manipulating spherical orbs, such as sorting, filtering, and transforming data values.

Orb visualization: The project includes a set of visualization tools for rendering spherical orbs in 3D, including support for zooming, panning, and rotating the view.

Data export: The project allows users to export spherical orbs to a variety of file formats, including PNG, SVG, and OBJ.
